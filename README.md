# Deep Learning for neurodegenerative disease classification using gait data

This repository contains code, Jupyter notebooks and other resources corresponding to a project concerning the training and evaluation of neural architectures on gait data in order to classify different nerodegenrative diseases.

## Neurodegenerative disease gait data

The data used in this project comes from the Physionet ```gaitndd``` publicly available [database](https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/gaitndd/).

## Data preprocessing

The original signals from the Physionet gaitndd database will undergo a series of preprocessing steps, visualized in the image below, in order to build datasets that models can be trained on.
